# April 24, 2019 - MAY 1ST, 2019 DEVELOPMENT SPRINT
(Background on how this code came into existence.)

Reviewing the prioritized user stories. User stories to be picked. 

Our two target dates are: monday April 29th (choose not to meet if github works; stand by ) and Wednesday May 1st, when we meet for acceptance test. 

We consider this a sprint started. Lets be modest and see if we can get some done. In a normal workplace situation no user story should for example not take more that 20 hours.

Update progress. 

Finalize ‘one at the time’.
